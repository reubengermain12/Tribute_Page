            Bob Marley ranks among both the most popular and the most
            misunderstood figures in modern culture ... That the machine has
            utterly emasculated Marley is beyond doubt. Gone from the public
            record is the ghetto kid who dreamed of Che Guevara and the Black
            Panthers, and pinned their posters up in the Wailers Soul Shack
            record store; who believed in freedom; and the fighting which it
            necessitated, and dressed the part on an early album sleeve; whose
            heroes were James Brown and Muhammad Ali; whose God was Ras Tafari
            and whose sacrament was marijuana. Instead, the Bob Marley who
            surveys his kingdom today is smiling benevolence, a shining sun, a
            waving palm tree, and a string of hits which tumble out of polite
            radio like candy from a gumball machine. Of course it has assured
            his immortality. But it has also demeaned him beyond recognition.
            Bob Marley was worth far more.
